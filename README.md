# Diabetes Status Binary Classification based on Physical Symptoms
Binary Classification of Diabetes status based on binary physical features easy to understand by non-medical professionals

This project explores the relationships of common physiological characteristics and symptoms to the incidence of diabetes. The dataset mainly consists mainly of binary features to indicate the presence or absence of symptoms. Four different supervised binary classification approaches are used to model the relationship between said physiological symptoms and diabetes. High levels of accuracy and sensitivity are achieved across all models which indicates the possibility to prioritize diabetes checkups in communities where more expensive blood tests and hospital accessibility may be limited by looking out for studied physiological symptoms.

This repo contains the report and presentation of the final project.

4 models were used: Logistic Regression, Linear Discrimannt Analysis, Tree Predictors, and Random Forest
